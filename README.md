# Atari800MechanicalKeyboard
Adapters to create a mechanical keyboard for the Atari 800

Check out the video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw1XvRNVRGU

In this video I built a replacement keyboard for an Atari 800 using  the following project: [https://github.com/multifariousindust...](https://github.com/multifariousindustries/Atari800Keyboard/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file)
In the PCB folder on the GitHub page there is a .zip file that you just upload here: https://www.pcbway.com/Order/QuickOrd... to get a perfect PCB made. Just click on the "+ Add Gerber File" button, select the .zip file and choose how many you want.

Since the project is meant for the Hi-Tek (Stackpole) keyboard and I have a Mitsumi keyboard I had to design everything except for the PCB. So you can use the PCB from this project but need different key adapters.

I use these keyswitches: https://de.aliexpress.com/item/1005006386577016.html
